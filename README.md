# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissor


In this project we made a simple rock, paper and scissors.

First we imported the random module which is built-in in python interpreter.

Then we made a function call Win. In this function we added all the basic logic.

Then we took the input of user.

Then we generated a random number.

Then we added some more logic.

Then we were good to go !!

Thank  You !!
